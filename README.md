## Overview
Mind-Spa NG is currently carrying an in-house training assessment for its development team. This repository will be used to test the growth of our frontend team members. 

## The Challenge
Take a close look at this UI: https://www.lapa.ninja/post/cosmos-network/  and replicate its design in your web-app alongside a few modifications you decide to make with the following technologies: HTML5, SCSS, Bootstrap4 and JavaScript. It is important that you make use of VScode during this process. Pictures and icons can be sourced from the following places: Unsplash, Pexels, Bootstrap  Icons etc. (Website flow can be viewed using: https://cosmos.network/?ref=lapaninja)
